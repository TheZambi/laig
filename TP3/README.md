## Project information

- All requested functionalities are working.
- Two scenes: A farm with a picnic towel and gameboard on top of it and a room with a lamp and the gameboard on top of a table.
- Animations between all cameras.
- Possibility to view game movie in every player turn and end game movie. While playing the movie, every move is made with a delay of 1 second.
- Possibility to change bot difficulty and gamemode. Due to the time needed to calculate a move in harder difficulties we decided to make the game faster and for that reason difficulties only change the time a player has to make a move. If the time expires, the player instantly loses the game.
- Undo does different things depending on the gamemode. In Player vs Player, this command backtracks 1 move. When playing Player vs AI or AI vs player it backtracks 2 moves, so that the player can redo his move. When playing AI vs AI undo is disabled.
- Game score is done by a marker with all 3 colors in it, near the board. Timer and winner are displayed on a small "TV" near the board.
- Pieces are animated using interpolation and easing functions.
- There is an option to reset the game during a player turn, which resets the board state.
